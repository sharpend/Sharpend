Easy .NET development for linux

Sharpend aims to be a collection of tools which you can use for easy .NET development under linux without 
starting from the beginning every time.
It started some time ago when i was wondering if it's possible to do .NET development under linux.

So by and by i developed some tools and perhaps they are useful for some other people to.
There are no limitations in the kind of tools. They should just make the life easyer :)

For example:

- XML configuration file support (in home dirctory and so on)
- Glade Gtk3 Code Generator (build c# code from Glade 3)
- Gtk3 docking application
- custom gtk Treelist
- Taskmanager (if you want to execute some jobs written in c#)
- Gtk Databinding support (Databind your objects to Gtk controls)
